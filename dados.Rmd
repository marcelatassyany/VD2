This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 





```{r include=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(GGally)
library(pscl)
library(broom)
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr) # devtools::install_github("hadley/modelr")

theme_set(theme_bw())
```

```{r}
etnia <- read_csv("Etnia.csv")

etnia2 <- etnia %>% 
  filter(gender != "-")

write.csv(etnia2, "gender.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
